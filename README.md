AITS Descriptor: 2 - AI for shaping Transparency Statement: AI has been used to shape the initial and/or final parts of the activity. 

Description of AI Use:
I wrote most of the Python code myself. Before I started, I used an AI to help me plan out the overall structure and to explain how classes and text files actually work together. While I was coding, I ran into some bugs, so I used the AI to help me figure out what the error messages meant and to fix a couple of specific blocks of code that kept breaking. I basically just used it as a tutor to get unstuck, and I made sure to test all of its suggestions to make sure they actually worked before adding them to my final script.
